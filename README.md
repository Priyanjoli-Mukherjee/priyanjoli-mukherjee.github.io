I am currently working on.

## Scrollr

Scrollr is a prototype of a social media app that allows for direct messaging,
posting comments, and seeing tweets in a feed. The search feature can be used to filter the tweets, and can be used
by either searching for parts or the message or entering in a hashtag. The trends displayed on the left can also be
used to filter the tweets.

Clicking on a user name will filter by that user, and clicking on the "Replying To..." section will display the original
post that is being replied to. Clicking on the comment icon will allow the user to reply to the tweet, and clicking
the edit and delete icons will allow you to edit or delete your own post.

The message icon in the far upper right corner will allow you to peruse through the direct messages that others have
sent you. To start a new conversation, merely select a user from the dropdown and select "Message".
